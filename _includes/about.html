                    <p>I am a Chinese graduate from Computer Engineering, I've lived in Ottawa during my study and work for alomost 3 years. My passion is being a Web developer, along this way to be a successful developer, I always make my hands drity on many technologies, such as a bunch of JavaScript framwork (React, Angular, NodeJs, MongoDB, etc). I also enjoy digging into algorithm and data structure by solving various math-like problem, it makes me fulfilled when problem is sorted out, it could be more when I found a less time or space consumption solution.<p/>
                    <p>After a 3-month travel, I realize that I really need a new environment to develop myself further.</p>
